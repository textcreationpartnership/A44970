            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Propoſalls for the Future preventing of the Decreaſe of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this Realm.</head>
            <p>FIrſt, it is moſt evident, that this Iſland is ſo fertil, and ſo productive of all ſorts of corn, fleſh, and fiſh, and all other things neceſſary for the maintenance of it's inhabitants, that it can maintain thouſands more, than it is now peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled withall: It is alſo productive of many Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantable, and ſtaple Commodities, about which many thouſands might be employed more than are, or more than there are of the ordinary rank of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Nation. Theſe things are ſo true, that there needs no argument to Confirm them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is beyond all queſtion, That the ſtrength of the King, and Kingdome, both in peace, and war, conſiſts in the multitude of it's inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; and that the riches, and poverty of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have their riſe and original from the number or paucity of them; and by the ſame cauſes a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is rendred either conſiderable or inconſiderable amongſt it's Neighbours, as to Alliances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:37131:4"/>
            <p>So that it ſeems to be an affair of the cheifeſt concernment, to prevent the decreaſe of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of our Nation, and to propoſe a certain and undeniable method how ſuch a publique miſchief, may be remedied, which I ſhall endeavour briefly.</p>
            <p>None then that underſtands the conſtitution of this Nation can deny, but it's polity, fundamental laws, and government, are as juſt, and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, as any in the world, notwithſtanding in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry age, there is a neceſſity of abrogating Old, and eſtabliſhing New Laws, the reaſons, of ſome ceaſing, and new publique inconveniencies happening, which it is neceſſary to obviate by New Laws.</p>
            <p>Now with all thoſe penal Laws made againſt the moſt capital crimes, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as Felony, Burgla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Murder it ſelf, the King by his Proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, has a power to diſpenſe, either wholly by acquitting the Offender from puniſhment, or by Commutation of the greater puniſhment into a Leſs; nay the Law it ſelf doth daily admit ſuch a Commutation, by inflicting the burning in the hand (upon the eaſy terms of reading a verſe in the Bible), on theſe, who according to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of it are to loſe their lives.</p>
            <p>And theſe criminalls, being thus acquitted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Kings clemency, or the Law, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their former employs, or undertake any other lawful calling without any obſtacle or impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment.</p>
            <p>But let it be ſuppoſed, that a Malefactor is found guilty of ſome Capital crime, <hi>viz.</hi> Murder, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <pb n="3" facs="tcp:37131:4"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the King will not pardon, nor the Laws admit any Commutation for, but condemn him to the moſt ignominous death; yet this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is in a better, and more deſirable condition, than that to which the ſeverity, and cruelty of ſome inexorable men oftentimes reduce their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſubjects, whoſe miſery, according to ſome preſent Laws, it is not in the Kings power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, although at ſuch a time, when the King, and Nation ſtands in greateſt need of their help, and aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>To manifeſt this is not difficult, from the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent inſtances, and examples, of thoſe whom we every day ſee deprived of Liberty, caſt into priſons, where they are forced to live, under all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of miſery and want, and that irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, for ſome ſmall and trifling debt, which their poverty, (to which it may be they are reduced by Divine providence) not dishoneſty, is the cauſe of not paying. Now the terrour of theſe ſufferings, more dreadfull to a Generous Spirit, than the ſevereſt death, is one of the principal reaſons of drawing great numbers of people out of this Realm.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if we conſider the Sea-men, (than whom there is no rank of men more beneficial, nor neceſſary for <hi>England,</hi> being an Iſland.) The humours and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of theſe men are to be liberal, yea, even prodigal in their expences ſo long as the ſtock of their Wages laſt: that being conſumed, they venture fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon their credit, in hopes of a ſucceeding em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, <pb n="4" facs="tcp:37131:5"/>of which probably failing, longer then they did ſuppoſe, and being incapable of paying their impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent creditors, from whom they conſtantly fear the ſeverity of a priſon, they betake themſelves to ſome forreign Nation, as <hi>France, Holland, &amp;c.</hi> who are always ready to entertain ſuch uſeful perſons; where they fix, and never more to venture into <hi>England,</hi> nor have any deſire for their Native Countrey, probably having more ſtrong engagements of wife and children to oblige them to another Nation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The artificers, or handicrafts-men, do oftentimes either by miſpending what they acquire by their labour, or by providence, fall into penury and want, and prove engaged in debts, which they have no proſpect of paying, and therefore evidently diſcern that the miſeries of a priſon muſt be their portion, out of which, (being once confined to it) they ſee no poſſibility of being reſcued. Their next reſolution therefore, is to leave their Countrey, there being no other way, by which they can evade thoſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and preſerve their liberty. And to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves an encouragement to proſecute thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, they conſider their art and labour, will procure them, as plentiful a ſubſiſtance abroad, as at home.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The next that fall into calamity, various ways, are Farmers, who notwithſtanding their care, and indeſty, either by the ſmallneſs of their crops, the loſs of their ſtocks, or hard bargains, to which their ignorance betrays them, are frequently diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to ſatisfy their Land-lords, which though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <pb n="5" facs="tcp:37131:5"/>they prove charitable, and generous perſons, and coſider the undone condition of their diſtreſſed Tenants, yet oftentimes may prove men of much inhumanity, and will accept no ſatisfaction, beſides the ruine of their miſerable Debtors, which ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty puts many Countrey-men, (the want of whom cauſes ſuch large tracts of ground to lie un-occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed in
<hi>England</hi>) to try their future Fortunes in remote parts.</p>
            <p>Fourthtly, the laſt ſort of men I ſhall inſtance, are Merchants, and Tradesmen, many of which do ſuffer greater loſſe both by Sea and Land, then any other; and this is ſo incident to their very employs, that few can pretend an exemption. Sometimes their loſſes are ſo very great, that they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incapable with their ſmall remainder, to make any proportionable ſatisfaction. Therefore, nature her ſelf, whoſe firſt Law is ſelf-preſervation from miſery, inſtructs theſe men, rather than ſubmit to the cruelty, that ſome unrealed laws enables un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful Creditors to inflict on them, to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by flying their Countrey.</p>
            <p>From all this it muſt be evident to any unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced perſon, that ſo many leaving this Nation for fear of being impriſoned during their lives for debts, (which frequently providence and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftineſs has brought upon them;) And the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable confinement of ſuch multitudes to priſons, is the chief reaſon of drawing people out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Thoſe who eſcape are ordinarily followed by their Families. The confinement of thoſe who <pb n="6" facs="tcp:37131:6"/>are impriſoned, deprive the kingdome of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and proves the utter deſtruction of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. So that thoſe who upon this account leave the Land, and thoſe who are (as it were) buried alive in priſons, by the moſt moderate computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth not amount to ſo few, theſe twenty years laſt paſt, as ten thouſand perſons, one year with another, which in that duration of time, amount to two hundred thouſand, beſides that encreaſe, which might be reaſonably expected from ſuch a multitude.</p>
            <p>Now for the preventing of this greateſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and miſchief, for the future, theſe things are moſt humbly Propoſed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That ſome days may be ſet apart, every Term at
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and at the Aſſizes in every County, of which publique notice may before be given, upon which day the Keepers of all Priſons ſhall be obliged to bring all the Priſoners confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for debt, either to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall, if they are within the Cities of
<hi>London,</hi> or <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> or County of
<hi>Middleſex,</hi> or to the reſpective Aſſizes, and whatſoever priſoner, will give a true, and juſt account of all his Eſtate, both perſonal and real, upon Oath, and aſſigne it to his Creditors or other Truſtees for their uſe, and payment of debts as far as it will amount, ſhall be immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged; or if any priſoner, ſhall upon Oath, in any of thoſe places mentioned, before the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Judges, declare himſelf not to have any thing left to the value of then to be diſcharged from <pb n="7" facs="tcp:37131:6"/>priſon, and from his debts. The like power may alſo be conferred upon the Juſtices at the Quarter-Seſſions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There are yet in force, and unrepeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certain ancient Laws, which make Merchants, Shop-keepers, Graſiers, and all ſuch whoſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conſiſts in buying, and ſellings, Bankrupts, upon ſundry accounts, and for diverſe reaſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in thoſe Statute-Laws, which were of very good uſe at that time when Enacted, and would not want their conveniencies now, were they right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and according to their firſt intendment uſed. But many of this age are grown ſo cruel, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, that no former times can parrallel them, by which inhumane cauſes, they bring no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to themſelves, but ruine to the perſon they proſecute, and are the cauſe of a certain damage to the publique. In thoſe ancient, and more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable times , when thoſe ſtatutes were made, if the debtor were under ſuch circumſtances, that he could not by giving all he had, ſatisfy his credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, they did willingly accept of what he had, and he was ſet at liberty and freed from all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, and had ſome ſmall portion of his Eſtate returned, as a fund, upon which he might build his future fortunes.</p>
            <p>In this our age, if thoſe Statutes were made uſe of againſt the moſt juſt and honeſt perſon, though ſome, nay moſt of his creditors were ſo kinde and mercifull, to be contented with the debtors eſtate, proportionably to be divided amongſt them, yet if <pb n="8" facs="tcp:37131:7"/>he prove ſo unfortunate, as to be engaged to one who is of a cruel, and uncharitable diſpoſition, who has for any pretended cauſe taken up a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious pique againſt him, the kindneſs of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can be no advantage to him, neither is there any poſſible means to ſecure himſelf from ruine.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that many men of honeſt deſigns, and juſt principles, have been forced, after conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable loſſes, with their little that was left, to ſeek for ſecurity and refuge, in forreign parts, by which the Creditors were deprived, of what they might have had, the King and Kingdome, of that ſervice, and advantage they might have expected from whole families.</p>
            <p>To this may be added, what has frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that many have voluntarily offered their Creditors ten or fifteen ſhillings in the pound, to free themſelves from trouble and perplexity (if poſſible) whoſe eſtate after the deduction of the charges out of it, for the obtaining the Statute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and the ill diſpoſall, which was made of the reſt, has been ſo diminiſhed, that it could not afford two ſhillings in the pound.</p>
            <p>In order therefore to prevent alt theſe mentioned inconveniencies, both to the publique, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, it is humbly propoſed, that ther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream rigour of theſe Statutes be mitigated, which will much tend to publique good, as hath, and may further be demonſtrated: and that for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all Bankrupts may be ſummoned to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome Authority to be appointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <pb n="9" facs="tcp:37131:7"/>and there give a full, and juſt, and true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count upon Oath, of all their Eſtates Perſonall, Reall and in Reverſion, and deliver up all their Books, Bills, Bonds, and aſſigne their whole eſtates to their Creditors, to be proportianally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongſt them; and themſelves thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be freed from all future trouble, and proſecution.</p>
            <p>This courſe being taken, there will be encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to friends, and Relations, either to give or lend money to the debtor, or truſt him with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, by which he may <hi>de novo</hi> be put into a condition of living, and trading, and providing for his family, which otherwiſe muſt be ruined: nay the Creditors themſelves (ſuppoſe the debtor a man of honeſt principles) may by this means, get the remainder of their debts, which his eſtate could not pay. And this has been the practice of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, and is made uſe of in moſt Nations, ſo that if we look through Chriſtendom, we ſhall ſcarce finde that the Laws of any place, confine men to a perpetuall impriſonment, who relinquiſh their whole Eſtates to their creditors, (though this is not ſufficient to ſatisfy all dents.) And here I humbly deſire notice, may be taken, that ſo long as a Statute is in force againſt any, which muſt be till all creditors will agree, there can be no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any, to give, or lend the debtor any thing for a new fund; nor to credit him, for the Statute will reach whatſoever he hath in poſſeſſion.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:37131:8"/>
            <p>To all this there ſeems to lie two Objections.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It will hinder the great credit that is now given.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It will occaſion perjury, for many will forſwear themſelves to ſecure their Eſtates.</p>
            <p>As to the Firſt: For thoſe men, who will give no credit except they may have power to ruine the debtor if any contingent cauſe ſhould hinder the moſt exact payment, let ſuch keep their monies, and commodities, till they can diſpoſe of them to their own mindes, which if they do, others that are not of ſuch miſtruſtful tempers, will be very great gainers, who though ſometimes they ſhould meet with ſome l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſes, yet the greatneſs of their trade would make up, and compenſate theſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is much to be deſired, that no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit at all might be given for things of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, ſuch as meat, drink, cloathes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which would put men, who live idle lives, upon labour; theſe being things which muſt be had; and if ſo many multitudes of men and women who now ſpend their lives in Idleneſs, were neceſſitated to undertake ſome employment, it muſt needs bring a conſiderable advantage to the Nation. And this courſe would make the money of the Kingdom oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner circulate.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond Objection: That many will forſwear themſelves to ſecure their Eſtates; Let not only thoſe puniſhments which the Law has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready provided, be inflicted on the perjured perſon,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37131:8"/>but it may be made Felony without benefit of Clergy, or Treaſon, by which the worſt of men would be deterred from it, it being great odds, but ſome way or other, they will be diſcovered, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed.</p>
